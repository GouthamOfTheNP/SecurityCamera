# Security Policy

## Overview

We are committed to ensuring the security of our project, users, and their data. This policy outlines the practices and procedures we follow to maintain a secure environment. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to notify us promptly to help keep our users safe.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us immediately via email:

**Contact Email**: [newsgsnc@gmail.com](mailto:newsgsnc@gmail.com)

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- A detailed description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any supporting information, such as logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:
1. The project's codebase, including:
   - Live video feed server implementation.
   - User authentication mechanisms.
   - Any associated APIs or integrations.
2. Dependencies and libraries included in the project.
3. External services or components explicitly integrated into the project.

---

## Supported Versions

We prioritize security fixes for the most recent stable version of the project. Older versions may not receive updates unless critical vulnerabilities are identified.

---

## Security Best Practices

We follow these security best practices in our development process:
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive user data, including live video streams and authentication credentials, is never logged or shared unnecessarily.
- **Encryption**: Communication between the server and devices is secured using HTTPS or equivalent encryption protocols.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is implemented securely with mechanisms like hashed passwords and multi-factor authentication (if applicable).
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and third-party libraries are monitored for vulnerabilities and updated regularly.
- **Minimal Exposure**: Only necessary ports, endpoints, and resources are exposed to minimize attack surfaces.

---

## Vulnerability Response

1. **Assessment**: Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will evaluate its severity and potential impact.
2. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.
3. **Resolution**: Fixes will be prioritized based on severity, and patches will be released promptly. We will notify the reporter and, if appropriate, credit them for the discovery.
4. **Disclosure**: After resolving the vulnerability, we will disclose the issue in our changelog or release notes to maintain transparency with users.

## Exclusions

This policy does not cover:
- Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries not directly integrated or modified within this project.
- Misconfigurations or issues resulting from improper use of the project by end-users.
- Weaknesses in external systems or services used alongside this project.
